  /*
        Normally, Java has many Exception Classes which cover many issues
        Sometimes we need Custom Exception for 2 reasons;
            1) To make Java Exceptions more specific.
               "FileNotFoundException" has 2 reasons in it
               i)path can be wrong     ii)file doesn't exist
            2) To create some Exceptions for our application
              "IllegalGradeException" can be created for a school management system application.
            3) Custom Exceptions guide the developers not to break the application rules.
