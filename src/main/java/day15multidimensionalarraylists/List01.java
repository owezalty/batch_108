        When you create an Array, you have to declare the length of the array.
        But when you use "lists" no need to declare the number of elements at the beginning.
        "Lists" are flexible for length but Arrays are not
        Lists are for storing multiple data in the same data type
        Lists store non-primitive data types, Arrays can not.
        Lists can not store primitive data types.
        Lists have many useful methods, Arrays do not.
        Arrays are so fast
        Arrays uses memory so less
